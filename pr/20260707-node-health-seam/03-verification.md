# Verification

Run:

```sh
npm test --prefix sdk/node
bash tools/scripts/check-node-sdk-seam.sh
bash tools/scripts/check-sdk-ura-naming.sh
bash tools/scripts/check-sdk-scaffold.sh
bash tools/scripts/check-sdk-parity-matrix.sh
cargo run --bin sdk-conformance-runner -- --language node --adapter-report sdk/conformance/runner/node-action-adapter-report.json --format jsonl
git diff --check
```

Expected result: all commands pass and Node reports the shared
`health/api_vs_runtime` case only after public tests cover runtime health,
diagnostics, control-only readiness, malformed payloads, and transport failure.
