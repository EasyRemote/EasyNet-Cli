# Verification

Run:

```sh
npm test --prefix sdk/node
bash tools/scripts/check-node-sdk-seam.sh
bash tools/scripts/check-sdk-ura-naming.sh
bash tools/scripts/check-sdk-scaffold.sh
bash tools/scripts/check-sdk-parity-matrix.sh
bash tools/scripts/check-sdk-conformance-reports.sh
cargo run --bin sdk-conformance-runner -- --language node --adapter-report sdk/conformance/runner/node-action-adapter-report.json --format jsonl
git diff --check
```

Expected result: all commands pass. Node should remain undeclared for
`stream/backpressure_bound` until callback queue overflow and wire-code
projection are implemented to match the shared case exactly.
